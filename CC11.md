CC11: `Array Methods`
===

## TDD Challenges

Use the built-in jest testing in CRA to TDD the following functions. Create one set of files: one called `array-methods.js` and one file called `array-methods.test.js`. 

View the [Jest Docs for `expect` style of assertion](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers)


Basic test file looks like:

```js
import { returnTen } from './array-methods';

  test('it should return the last 10 characters of a string as an array', () => {
    expect(returnTen('hello world')).toStrictEqual(['e','l','l','o',' ','w','o','r','l','d']);
    expect(returnTen('world')).toStrictEqual(['w','o','r','l','d']);
  });

```
Use `npm test` to start your test runner locally.


## Return Ten

`Please use the above example code for your first exercise.`

Write a function named returnTen, takes in a string and uses split and splice to return the last 10 characters from that string as elements of an array.

```js
export function returnTen(str) {
    
}
```

## Find Max

Write a function named findMax that takes in a matrix of positive numbers and returns the number with the highest value.

For example:
[
  [1, 3, 4, 5],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [23, 5, 5]
]

return: 23

```js
export function findMax(matrix) {
    
}
```

In | Out
---|---
[[13,24,24,2], [2,5,6], [2,3]] | 24

## Total Sum

Write a function named totalSum that takes in a matrix of numbers and returns the totalSum of all the numbers.

For example:
[
  [1, 3, 4, 5],
  [4, 5, 1],
  [2, 5, 5]
]

return: 35

```js
export function totalSum(matrix) {
    
}
```

In | Out
---|---
[[13,24,24,2], [2,5,6], [2,3]] | 81
[] | 0


## Store: Hours Open

You friend Pat has a chain of stores around the greater Seattle area. He specializes in selling salmon cookies. Pat has data for the hourly sales of cookies per hour for each store. He wants to create an array of the total number of cookies sold per hour for all of his stores combined.

Write a function named grandTotal that adds up the cookies sales for each hour of operation for all of the stores combined. For example, the first element in the hourlySales array should be the sum of the cookies sold in the 9:00 a.m. hour at all five stores combined.

For this example, the total at 9:00 a.m. is 17 + 26 + 7 + 5 + 33, or 88 total cookies.

Return the array of the total number of cookies sold per hour for all of the stores combined.


`The following data will be used for this hoursOpen test and the salesData test:`
```js
const hoursOpen = ['9 a.m.', '10 a.m.', '11 a.m.', '12 p.m.', '1 p.m.', '2 p.m.', '3 p.m.', '4 p.m.', '5 p.m.', '6 p.m.', '7 p.m.', '8 p.m.'];

const firstPike = [17, 18, 23, 24, 24, 12, 13, 27, 30, 20, 24, 18];
const seaTac = [26, 5, 5, 59, 23, 39, 38, 20, 30, 7, 59, 43];
const seattleCenter = [7, 14, 19, 22, 15, 4, 23, 27, 28, 23, 1, 29];
const capHill = [5, 85, 58, 51, 50, 13, 33, 32, 47, 94, 31, 62];
const alkiBeach = [33, 31, 147, 130, 27, 93, 38, 126, 141, 63, 46, 17];

const cookieStores = [firstPike, seaTac, seattleCenter, capHill, alkiBeach];

export function grandTotal(stores){
  
}
```

For your test file:

```js
  test('It should create an object of data for each store', () => {
    expect(salesData(hoursOpen, grandTotal(cookieStores))).toStrictEqual([
      { sales: '88 cookies', time: '9 a.m.' },
      { sales: '153 cookies', time: '10 a.m.' },
      { sales: '252 cookies', time: '11 a.m.' },
      { sales: '286 cookies', time: '12 p.m.' },
      { sales: '139 cookies', time: '1 p.m.' },
      { sales: '161 cookies', time: '2 p.m.' },
      { sales: '145 cookies', time: '3 p.m.' },
      { sales: '232 cookies', time: '4 p.m.' },
      { sales: '276 cookies', time: '5 p.m.' },
      { sales: '207 cookies', time: '6 p.m.' },
      { sales: '161 cookies', time: '7 p.m.' },
      { sales: '169 cookies', time: '8 p.m.' }
    ]);
```

## Store: Sales Data

Pat has decided that he would also like to organize his data as objects containing the number of cookies sold per hour and the time.

Here is sample data for the 9:00 sales: { sales: '88 cookies', time: '9 a.m.' }.

Write a function named salesData that uses forEach to iterate over the hourlySales array and create an object for each hour. Return an array of the formatted data.

```js
export function salesData(hours, data){
  
}
```

For your test file:

```js
  test('salesData function', () => {

    expect(salesData(hoursOpen, grandTotal(cookieStores)).length).toStrictEqual(hoursOpen.length);
  });
```
